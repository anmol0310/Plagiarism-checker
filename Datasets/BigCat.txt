The term "big cat" is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus Panthera, namely the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the 
non-pantherine cheetah and cougar.[1][2] However, only the first 4 of these species are able to roar.
Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the 
other big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and some are efficient apex predators.[3] Their native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia; the leopard's range also extends 
into Europe, specifically in Russia.
It is estimated that the ancestors of most big cats split away from the Felinae about 6.37 million years ago.[4] The Felinae, on the other hand, comprises mostly small to medium-sized 
cats, including the domestic cats, but also some larger cats such as the cougar and cheetah.[5]

A 2010 study published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution has given insight into the exact evolutionary relationships of the big cats.[6] The study reveals that the snow 
leopard and the tiger are sister species, while the lion, leopard, and jaguar are more closely related to each other. The tiger and snow leopard diverged from the ancestral big cats 
approximately 3.9 Ma. The tiger then evolved into a unique species towards the end of the Pliocene epoch, approximately 3.2 Ma. The ancestor of the lion, leopard, and jaguar split from 
other big cats from 4.3–3.8 Ma. Between 3.6–2.5 Ma the jaguar diverged from the ancestor of lions and leopards. Lions and leopards split from one another approximately 2 Ma.[7] 
The earliest big cat fossil, Panthera blytheae, dating to 4.1−5.95 MA, was discovered in southwest Tibet.[8]
